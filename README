This is a project I wrote some time in my life for my Sister. She likes a type of seam called "Ponto Cruz" in portuguese, I guess it is called "cross stitch" in english.To use the program, click on the new icon and choose an image file. The program will try to create the diagram.I could continue this project and improve a lot of things on it, like applying effects on the image before converting, color reduction and some other things my sister had asked me at that time...
